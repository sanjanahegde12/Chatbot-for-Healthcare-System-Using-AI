# Chatbot-for-Healthcare-System-Using-AI
Healthcare is very important to lead a good life. However, it is very difficult to obtain a
consultation with a doctor for every health problem. The idea is to create a medical chatbot
using Artificial Intelligence that can diagnose the disease and provide basic details about the
disease before consulting a doctor. This will help to reduce healthcare costs and improve
accessibility to medical knowledge through medical chatbots. 
    Since it is my first experience on Python with ML , i have added some of health symptoms in python code as example.
we can also add some more health information& symptoms to the .py file for more accuracy.
